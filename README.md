# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning

A comprehensive sentiment analysis project comparing LSTM and GRU architectures for binary classification of Amazon product reviews.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements and compares two neural network architectures (LSTM vs GRU) for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow/Keras. The model classifies Amazon product reviews as positive or negative sentiment with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Advanced text cleaning with NLTK (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal)
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementation of both LSTM and GRU architectures
- **Model Comparison**: Side-by-side performance evaluation
- **Visualization**: Training history plots with loss curves and best epoch markers
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting with intelligent training termination
- **Professional Code Structure**: Modular, well-documented functions

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Python 3.7+**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** - Deep learning framework
- **NLTK** - Natural language processing
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Train/test splitting

## 📊 Model Architectures

### LSTM Model
```
Input → Embedding(64) → LSTM(64) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(1, sigmoid)
```

### GRU Model
```
Input → Embedding(64) → GRU(64) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(16, ReLU) → Dense(1, sigmoid)
```

## 🎯 Performance

- **Dataset**: Amazon Product Reviews (20,000 samples)
- **Class Distribution**: 76.17% Positive, 23.83% Negative
- **Test Accuracy**: 76.05% for both models
- **Training Time**: ~12 seconds per epoch
- **Early Stopping**: Applied with patience=2 on validation loss

### Detailed Results

| Model | Test Accuracy | Test Loss | Training Epochs | Winner |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| LSTM  | 76.05%       | 0.5506    | 7 (early stop)  | -      |
| GRU   | 76.05%       | 0.5505    | 6 (early stop)  | ✓      |

**Key Findings:**
- Both models achieved identical test accuracy (76.05%)
- GRU slightly outperformed LSTM with marginally lower loss (0.5505 vs 0.5506)
- GRU required one less epoch to reach optimal performance
- Early stopping effectively prevented overfitting in both models

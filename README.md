# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning

A comprehensive sentiment analysis project comparing LSTM and GRU architectures for binary classification of Amazon product reviews.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements and compares two neural network architectures (LSTM vs GRU) for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow/Keras. The model classifies Amazon product reviews as positive or negative sentiment with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Advanced text cleaning with NLTK (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal)
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementation of both LSTM and GRU architectures
- **Model Comparison**: Side-by-side performance evaluation
- **Visualization**: Training history plots with loss curves and best epoch markers
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting with intelligent training termination
- **Professional Code Structure**: Modular, well-documented functions

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Python 3.7+**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** - Deep learning framework
- **NLTK** - Natural language processing
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Train/test splitting

## 📊 Model Architectures

### LSTM Model
```
Input → Embedding(64) → LSTM(64) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(1, sigmoid)
```

### GRU Model
```
Input → Embedding(64) → GRU(64) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(16, ReLU) → Dense(1, sigmoid)
```

## 🎯 Performance

- **Dataset**: Amazon Product Reviews (positive/negative sentiment)
- **Test Accuracy**: ~85%+ for both models
- **Training Time**: ~5-10 minutes on standard hardware
- **Model Size**: Lightweight (~2MB each)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install tensorflow nltk pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
